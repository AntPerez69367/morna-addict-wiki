# Subpath Information


Subpaths are added branches of specialty skill sets players can choose to delve into once they reach Lvl 50. Each Subpath brings its own unique approach and feel to the game, and adds onto the based concepts of the primary paths, sometimes fusing them with others to form a sort of “Class Hybrid”. Once you reach level 50, you must complete three trials before being able to join a path.

To learn more about each subpath, visit their page on the wiki, which will contain a summary of the path, their lore, spells, and more.

## Joining a Subpath 

To start the quest, you must be Level 50, and speak to the NPC at the Subpath Public Area you wish to join. (See Coordinates in the associated sections below for locations) Before you can join the path, you will be given three trials to complete.

### Tabs {.tabset}
#### Trial of Growth 
Must Complete One Spider Trial (Can be done before hand)

#### Trial of Dedication 
Must Complete One Mythic Tribute (Can be done before hand)

#### Trial of Combat 
You will be given a quest to kill one of 4 Mythic Bosses; Rooster Key Boss, Rooster Item Boss, Dog Key Boss or Dog Item Boss. The type of boss is specific to the path you are choosing. This is the only task you have to wait to complete after you receive the trials.
