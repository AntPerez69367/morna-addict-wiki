# Heart Staff

There are two methods for obtaining a heart staff. You can either immediately forge it upon reaching 30 points of Karma or you can wait and forge it later. However you will need 30 points of karma regardless.

> **Warning**: Upon making a Heart Staff your karma will drop to 0 and you may be unable to progress through the armor quest lines until you get it back up to the required level.

## Option 1
1.  Upon reaching 30 points of Karma you will receive a pop-up asking if you would like to make the staff or not.


## Option 2

1. If you chose to not make the staff once you reached 30 karma you can head to the Pillars of Truckovich which are located at south gate in Cold Iron Plains (032,058).

2. There are 4 totems representing each of the classes. Find your totem and click on it.
