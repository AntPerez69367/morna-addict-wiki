######  **Description**
 Berserkers are a group of bloodthirsty and battleworn freelancers. Berserkers specialize in vicious attacks that deal substantial damage, with additional abilities that help them push themselves to the limits and protect them in their battles. 
 
######  Lore
 The word Berserker.  Immediately, the image of a brutish warrior swinging a massive sword, cleaving multiple enemies in one shot, comes to mind.  Your image is not far off.  But it's a lot more than that.

Each berserker could be different from the next.  Rage is a fickle thing.  Anyone can get mad, but few know how to channel this emotion to fuel their muscles and minds, causing them to perform impressive feats of strength and devastate the front lines of any vanguard.  Berserkers feel nothing in battle, with a mindset to overcome their foe, allowing nothing to stand in their way.

We come from varied backgrounds, each able to achieve that focus and intensity that grants a berserker the means to be a terror in combat.  Some channel a great pain to avenge.  Others are naturally gifted with brute strength, and have trained their lives with massive weapons to strike decisively.  Yet others are fueled by unhuman means.  It is up to each individual to share their own story, why they are here, and how they have come to possess such freakish strength.

Because of the mixture of personalities and backgrounds, where differing cultures could normally cause conflict, the berserkers collectively are a free people.  They answer to no one but who they choose.  This freedom they see as their greatest treasure, and will do anything to ensure they are always in control of what they fight for.  Thus, some berserkers will gladly offer their sword for hire.  Others may choose to serve as a vanguard in an army.  Others seek only battle, wherever and however they find it.  Ultimately, it is the ability to choose that is a berserker's greatest treasure.

A berserker will call home wherever they choose, but there has been a hall constructed in the area that offers them a common place to rest, eat, and possibly find something of interest.  Most berserkers will gladly aid those they would call shield-brother or sister because of the common basic ground they stand upon.  However, it is not uncommon for a berserker to stand their ground against another.  The result can be devastating to them, and those near them whenever that occurs.

Let none of this throw you.  Just because a berserker may seem overcome by their bloodlust, they are very smart.  A berserker not only knows how to swing their weapon (be it fist or blade), but they also know how to strategize in a battle, going for weak points and observing the flow of battle.  All these traits allow the berserker not only the ability to overcome what is in front of them, but also succeed in the overall larger path they have been set upon.
