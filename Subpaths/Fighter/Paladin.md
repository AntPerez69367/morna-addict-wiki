### Lore and History
 - **Public Area (057, 074 East Gate of Cathay)**
###### Overview
Paladins are the classic “Fighter/Healer” combo. As a fighter turned Paladin, you are given extra spells such as better heals, mana restoration, and protection spells to better sustain yourself and your allies.
###### Lore
We are natural adventurers, lone wolves as we chart the unbroken frontier. Once bound by duty, a Paladin is the original renegade and reports to no one but themselves.

Us Paladins are an easy going and self-reliant folk, and although there’s no cookie cutter paladin personality we have one truth that is common among all of us - the perpetual craving for adventure.

We all learned early on that there are few places we fear to travel, we’re strong enough to fend off danger and heal our own wounds - Hell, we can tend to anyone elses too. Being self-reliant doesn’t mean we’re introverted, you’ll see a lot of us around shooting the breeze. If you’re craving blood lets share the thrill of the hunt. We love a good party too, c’mon over and kick it with your pals sometime.

We are an ancient order. There was a time that the Paladins served the royal families of the kingdoms dutifully and exclusively, and as time passed more and more shed their royal crest to commit to a life of adventure, intrigue and excitement. Now they serve the entire community, not just its leaders.

We come from all corners of the map and meet here at our sacred mountain top. You made your oath long ago and something bigger has brought you here, and it’s the same thing that bonds us all together.

It is your vow to the light that you owe your strength and now it’s time to rise and prove your worth. The light isn’t good, it isn’t bad, you chose it to reach your fullest potential and only together can we be stronger than you or I ever imagined. 
###### 
**Paladin's Creed**
The thrill of the hunt courses through your veins, but you’ve always known you have more to give. Dexterity and multitasking always came easy to you. You are the sword and the shield. Your terrifying prowess in battle is only matched by your ability to defend and protect.

Something deep inside you gives you the thirst for blood, and the compassion to put the health and well-being of your entire team ahead of your own for the greater glory of the hunt. You follow a path of purpose and duty.

Staunchly self reliant and dependable, with the brawn of behemoth and the spirit of a healer the paladin are known for their charisma and willingness to put themselves in harms way, confident that their strength can overcome. Our loud bellowing roar can get the attention of any beast in ear shot, we withstand any adversary that rises to the call. We can break bonds that the Gods have forged and purge curses from our own veins. Our abilities are only matched by our valiance and unparalleled bravery in the face of danger.

**In the dark we shine. We don’t survive, we thrive. We are Paladins.**
