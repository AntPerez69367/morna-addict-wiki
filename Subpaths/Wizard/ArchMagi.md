### Lore and History
 - **Public Area (005, 003 Hon by the Sea) (Must access via underground)**
###### Overview 
The Archmage path provides members with strong healing and protection abilities. They gain aspects of the priest's ability set, as well as a teleportation spell that let's them slide out of sticky situations. They also gain a unique ability to generate mana, and rarely need to stoop to using the traditional Invoke spell. 
###### Lore
"Worship no gods and have faith only in yourself. Cherish knowledge young Archmage, because those with small minds outnumber the stars themselves. "

-Lady Anathema, Chapter Master and Prime Archmage

The Primis Archmage Chapter

The Archmage: Nation Crafters

Every Archmage is recognized as a Master of Public Administration and Policy Crafting. Coveted by Kingdoms for their expertise in civil affairs, they are known throughout history as "Nation Crafters". Their primary focus is the implementation of peacekeeping policies between nations, technological advancements for the commoners and economic reform.

Archmagi are Scholars of Wizardry who have an affinity to the dimensional phenomenon known as the Immaterium. This affinity allows them to manipulate Chaos Energies from the Immaterium to their will. Though a Priest may be more efficient in mending flesh and the Paladin a more steadfast defender of the weak, the Archmage is suitable for both roles if required. However, they are more useful when facilitating institutional changes which brings economic, political, and educational prosperity on those Client Governments who accept the Chapter’s assistance.

Rumors and Whispers

-=-=-=-=-=-

The Primis Archmage Chapter has been lauded for great deeds to society and contributions to their client Kingdoms. There is a growing concern that their true intentions for helping the world is of a more sinister nature. Rumors of unnatural abilities, cult-like rituals and the amassing of political and economic influence by the Chapter has long been a concern of many Kingdom Royals and Military Leaders.

References to the Chapter has been recorded in history books as far back as 100 years ago. However, some ancient texts have referenced several concepts related to the Chapter dating back to several centuries. Some of these concepts include the “Immaterianos”, people who were known as “Archmagus Princepts”, and a phrase which is repeated often, “Pario Divinita Terra.”

Although these translations are not used today when referencing the Archmagi or their Chapter, the similarities suggest they are either closely related or have been adapted by the present day Chapter. The phrase: “Pario Divinita Terra”, in particular, is used to this day by the Chapter as its creed. The true meaning of the phrase is not known to outsiders.  Though the Chapter is one of the world’s oldest organizations, exactly how the Chapter selects its members is still a mystery to all but the Chapter itself.

Several years ago, reports surfaced from a clandestine investigation which was conducted on the Primis Archmage Chapter by an unnamed Nation. Little information was discovered save for one thing. There has only ever been one leader of the Chapter and who carries official two titles. The first is “Chapter Master,” which signifies they are the leader of the Primis Archmage Chapter. The second, and most interesting, is the title of “Prime Archmage”. This title is assigned to the Founder of the Primis Archmage Chapter. If one were to believe the leaked information as fact, then you would assume the Chapter Master is among the most ancient of mortals roaming the world. There are no other documents or references, which can corroborate these claims. In addition, the identity of the investigator and client has never been released. To this day, most commoners consider the information an attempt to slander the Chapter by defeated political rivals. Others with a more conspiratorial mindset believe the Chapter has several secrets worth investigating...

The Archmage Conspiracy

-=-=-=-=-=-

More recently, the Primis Archmage Chapter was found to be connected to the “Lost July" incident. Officially, "Lost July," was coined when the entire Kingdom of July was destroyed by some unknown disaster. The destruction of July was discovered by its neighbor Kingdom some weeks after it occurred. Reports from traveling merchants indicated there were no survivors left in the city. Every citizen found suffered the same fate. Each was found with crushed bones and gruesomely contorted bodies. Every building for miles was leveled into rubble. Not a single structure was left standing, leading most to believe that a tornado had passed through the area.

During an investigation by the neighboring kingdom, a sole survivor was discovered -- an Archmage who served as the King's Advisor. Once discovered, subsequent attempts to interview the Archmage were blocked by the Chapter Master on the basis that any interrogation beyond that done by the Chapter itself would bring undue stress to an Archmage who had already suffered unimaginable mental and physical scars from "Lost July."

To this date, the Chapter has refused to provide any details related to “Lost July” or the fate of its people. The Archmage in question has never been named, referenced, or even acknowledged to have ever existed by the Chapter.

Conversations Overheard

::Recorded by [Anonymous Scribe]

::Location, Hon Palace Grounds

::Subjects, Elder Slumberjack & Lady Anathema

Slumberjack, First Representative of Paladin Posterity:  “Oh, Archmagi? Well, obviously I don’t know much. We share many of the same philosophies, that’s a great sign. Aristotle, Cicero, Plato and other surreptitious texts are the source of our power. You and I, Anathema, we see the same outcome, but with two different road maps to get there.“

“Similarly, Paladins have been firmly rooted in kingdom governance across Morna for generations. This respect is due to the value of our word and power of our influence. By virtue of our providence, the Archmage and Paladin have a huge responsibility to both the locals and pioneers settling these lands. Hopefully we can keep the peace ourselves for the sake of the rest.

Lady Anathema, Chapter Master and Prime Archmage: “With these eyes I can see the goodness in your heart, Mr. Paladin. I wish for nothing more than a world where peace reigns and love prospers. I look forward to your assistance in this and I’ll offer all that I can."
