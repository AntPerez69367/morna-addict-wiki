### Lore and History
 - **The Vampire public area is located at Cathay (013, 005)**
###### Overview
At present, Vampire is the only path in Morna with targeted vita attacks and the ability to reduce another players mana in pk. By alternating between vita and mana attacks, Vampires have an edge in pk and group hunting with devastating damage. 
###### Lore
 The Brood:
Vampire is the essence of freedom and indulgence. We have given up those things that made us human, the pain and suffering, the expectations and false hope, and have instead embraced an existence of eternal bliss - with just a touch of savagery.

There is no right or wrong way to enjoy immortality. However, the members of this brood have agreed to a fairly simple philosophy. Maintain neutrality, unless crossed or otherwise insulted. Should this occur, it is our right - our obligation - to show no mercy and destroy our foes.
