### Lore and History
###### Overview
The Warlock Legion is a Subpath started by Furycrafters from another world. Through the magics that Wizards in Morna inherently possessed, they are able to make a pact with Alera, a being that is the embodiment of all Furies from their previous world, in order to harness the Elemental capabilities of Furycrafting for their own uses. 
###### Lore
As penned by Cursor Callidus Aeshma ex Cursori:

The Legions have stood the test of time. Their unyielding strength and resolve had been the driving sword and the obdurate shield of the Aleran people for generations upon generations. The use of Furycrafting came long ago. So long, in fact, there was considerable debate among scholars as to whether or not our people were ever without it, the details lost to time.

Our particular Legion detachment was a part of the Crown Legion of the First Lord of Alera, led by the Princeps Gaius Septimus and his Cursors and Singulares, some of the most powerful Furycrafters in all the realm. The Crown Legion was assigned to the farthest reaches of the land, not long after a fierce battle. Officially, the reason was to ensure continued stability in the region - though most knew it was to afford the Princeps and the remainder of the Crown Legion time to rest after the heavy losses. 

It was here that our recent history becomes... fuzzy. 

The founders of the Warlock path are not of these lands. There's no telling how many of us from the Crown legion were brought over to this new world, as some of our fellow Alerans have since found their way to our new home. 

We're still uncertain as to how we arrived. Myself, Princeps Septimus, and his wife Isana arrived in the same general area, perhaps due to our proximity to each other within the Legion camp upon our extraction from Alera. 

For now, we have no choice but to learn of our new home, the people within, and perhaps in time we will learn the reasons for which we were chosen to be relocated, and hopefully find our way back. Until this time, we will recruit those who have the gift of Furycrafting within their minds, yet to be unlocked, rebuild our Legion, and prosper; for we are Alerans... And Alerans fear nothing.
