# Crusader
 ## Tans {.tabset}
  ### Lore and History
 - **Public Area (017,005 Gip Village)**
######  Description
 Crusaders are priests who have chosen to channel their powers and efforts into the arts of war. This path combines aspects of the Priest (Healing, Curses, etc.) with additional Fighter-like skills such as additional damage boosts, flank, and vita attacks. The path is excellent for soloing, but also works well for group hunting.
