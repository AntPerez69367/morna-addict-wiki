# Ranger
## Tans {.tabset}
  ### Lore and History
######   Overview 
Ranger is a high damage AoE path. They excel at soloing, when fighting lower experience mobs, as they clear very fast with high swing damage. Although, they would be foolish to fight higher end mobs alone. They work well when paired with a class that can heal and assist. They are great in PvP due to snipe and piercing shot.
