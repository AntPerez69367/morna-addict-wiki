>MornaTK features 2 Main "Cities" that act as a Hub and Starting Zone for adventures, several smaller Hubs like Minor Towns/Villages, as well as Hunting Areas. Major cities have a "Gate Guard" feature, where you are able to click a guard, and receive a teleport (For a small fee) to places in the city. You are able to travel between these City/Hub areas by means of "Eye of Teleportation". Click the Links below to see the maps of the area and a list of locations for each map.
