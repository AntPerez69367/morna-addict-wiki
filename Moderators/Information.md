# Welcome

Welcome if you are seeing this then you have been selected as a moderator of the MornaAddict Wiki. You will have access to remove pages and comments as well as see and edit just about anything. 

## Responsibilities

I only ask that you do your best to contribute to the site and keep the information we have available accurate and without bias. As a moderator if you find someone posting false information or harassing other members of the site you will get to bring down the hammer of justice.

## Questions

Feel free to ask Materia any questions about being a moderator.
